# Plant Shop üå±üåºüíê 
The website was designed to be a plant e-commerce. Here users will be able to find any plant they want, being it flowers, pots, bouquets or house plants. It's also possible to rent flowers for a special ocasion. 

## Requirements
* The system will have 2 types of users: Clients and Administrators:
  * Administrators are responsible for registering/managing administrators, customers, and products/services provided. The application already comes with an account admin with password admin.
  * Customers are users who access the system to buy products/services.
* The admin record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email, address.
* Each customer's record includes, at least: name, id, address, phone, email.
* Product/services records include, at least: name, id, photo, description, price, quantity (in stock), quantity sold.
* The store will sell plants and decoration services.
* Selling Products: Products are selected, their quantity chosen, and are included in a cart. Products are purchased using a credit card number (any number is accepted by the system). The quantity of product sold is subtracted from the quantity in stock and added to the quantity sold. Carts are emptied only on payment or by customers.
* Product Management: Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new products and services. For example, they can change the stock quantity.
* The system must provide accessibility requirements and provide good usability. The system must be responsive.
* One service provided is a flower decoration rent, where the customer can check all the available time for decoration and rent of a specific theme (for example, a wedding or a birthday party) for the period of time needed.  

## Project Description

### Flow Diagram

### Data storage
Our project will store all users data such as password, email, name, phone number and address in a specific database. The products info will also be stored in a dedicated database.

### Limitations
In this phase of the project, the application is being saved **locally** so it's only possible to simulate the server database functionality for a **single client**.

### Screens
#### Homepage
This page contains an overview of our products. There we can check out the products on sale and some product categories. In the top, we have a slider showing the products on sale.

#### Login
The page of login has a form, that requires the email and the password. There is also the option to go to the sign up page, if the user doesn't have an account. 

#### Sign up
The page of sign up has a form, that requires the name, email, phone number and the password. There is also the option to go to the login page, if the user already has an account. 

#### Profile Page
This page shows user's infos in the left and its previous and current orders in the right. Users will be able to edit its infos, except password.

#### Admin Page
This page shows admin's infos. Admins will be able to go to the inventory management page, and also will be able to go the admin register page, to register another admin. New administrators can only be added by another administrators.

#### Category Page
There are four pages of categories of plants: plants (in general) üå±, flowers üå∑, bouquets üíê and pots üå≥. In this pages, we have all of the plants in the store that fit into that category. 

#### Rent Flower (Special Feature)
In this page users will be able to schedule a flower rent, the rents will appear in the cart.


## Comments About the Code
Our entire website is curentily built using HTML5, CSS3 and React. For managing the state of the application, we used Redux. We have chosen to use Typescript integration with React since we believe that typing our variables, functions, etc. would avoid headaches related to the project size.  

## Test Plan

We plant to test the all user pages, including:

- Home page
- Product pages
  - Plants page 
  - Flowers page
  - Bouquets page
  - Pots page
- Rent page
- Login page
- Register page
- User profile page
- Shopping cart page
- Administrator page

Besides that, we will test all major functionalities, including:

- General actions:

- User actions:
  - Adding product to cart
  - Removing product from cart
  - Creating new user
  - Scheduling rent
- Admin actions:

## Build Procedures

### Software

We're using the following versions of node and npm:

    $ node -v
    v10.24.1
    $ npm -v
    6.14.12

Install them using your favorite software, like nvm or your package manager.

### Installation

To install, run the following:

    $ cd ps
    $ npm install
    $ npm run-script build

Make sure the version of node and npm are the exact same as mentioned above.

To run the server you will also need the serve package. To install it, run:

    $ npm install -g serve

### Running

After running the installation procedures, run the following inside the ps folder:

    $ serve build

Now you will have a node instance running at http://localhost:3000!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Problems
No problems.

## Comments
Our group never had to deal with such a big project like this one. Also, we have never developed with React.
