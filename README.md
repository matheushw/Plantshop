## Build Procedures

### Software

We're using the following versions of node and npm:

    $ node -v
    v10.24.1
    $ npm -v
    6.14.12

Install them using your favorite software, like nvm or your package manager.

### Installation

To install, run the following:

    $ cd ps
    $ npm install
    $ npm run-script build

Make sure the version of node and npm are the exact same as mentioned above.

To run the server you will also need the serve package. To install it, run:

    $ npm install -g serve

### Running

After running the installation procedures, run the following inside the ps folder:

    $ serve build

Now you will have a node instance running at http://localhost:5000!
