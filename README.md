# Plant Shop üå±üåºüíê 
The website was designed to be a plant e-commerce. Here users will be able to find any plant they want, being it flowers, pots, bouquets or house plants. It's also possible to rent flowers for a special ocasion. 

## Requirements
* The system will have 2 types of users: Clients and Administrators:
  * Administrators are responsible for registering/managing administrators, customers, and products/services provided. The application already comes with an account admin with password admin.
  * Customers are users who access the system to buy products/services.
* The admin record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email, address.

* Product Management: Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new products and services. For example, they can change the stock quantity.

## Comments About the Code
Our entire website is curentily built using HTML5, CSS3 and React. For managing the state of the application, we used Redux. We have chosen to use Typescript integration with React since we believe that typing our variables, functions, etc. would avoid headaches related to the project size.  

## Test Plan

We plant to test the all user pages, including:

- Home page
- Product pages
  - Plants page 
  - Flowers page
  - Bouquets page
  - Pots page
- Rent page
- Login page
- Register page
- User profile page
- Shopping cart page
- Administrator page

Besides that, we will test all major functionalities, including:

- General actions:
  - Log in
  - Log out
- User actions:
  - Adding product to cart
  - Removing product from cart
  - Creating new user
  - Scheduling rent
- Admin actions:
