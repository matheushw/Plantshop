The website was designed to be a plant e-commerce. Here users will be able to find any plant they want, being it flowers or house plants. It's also possible to rent flowers for a special ocasion and get a decoration service. 
## Requirements

  * Administrators are responsible for registering/managing administrators, customers, and products/services provided. The application already comes with an account admin with password admin.
  * Customers are users who access the system to buy products/services.

* Product Management: Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new products and services. For example, they can change the stock quantity.
